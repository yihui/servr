This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown, see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. This document can be compiled by either R Markdown [v1](http://cran.rstudio.com/package=markdown) or [v2](http://cran.rstudio.com/package=rmarkdown), and you can serve it by either `servr::rmdv1` or `servr::rmdv2` accordingly.

You can include an R code chunk:

```{r}
if (TRUE) {
  1 + 1
}
rnorm(10)
summary(cars)
knitr::kable(head(mtcars))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(cars, pch = 20, col = 'red')
```

After you start **servr** for this document, you can click `example.html` to view it, then edit and save this R Markdown document, and you will see the HTML output file is automatically reloaded in your browser.

```{r}
servr::serve_example('rmd', servr::rmdv1)
# or
servr::serve_example('rmd', servr::rmdv2)
```

Session info:

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
