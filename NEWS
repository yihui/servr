- you can disable websocket listening on an HTML page using a special HTML
  comment `<!-- DISABLE-SERVR-WEBSOCKET -->` when servr is serving and watching
  a directory, so that this page will not communicate with R (e.g. when it is

  automatically via Makefile (#2)

- the URL pathname foo will be redirected to foo/ automatically if foo is a

  double the delay to check for updates and wait for the next build until the
  error is cleared (like Gmail)
